- Comedic Roast Commentary: Generate humorous and playful commentary based on the GitHub data. The tool ensures the AI roast is relevant and avoids personal or hateful content.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant white (#FFFFFF) for a high-energy, modern feel, reminiscent of streaming platforms and digital artistry.
- Background color: Dark navy (#1A202C), a desaturated version of the primary purple, provides contrast and lets the stats pop.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#63B3ED) used for highlights and interactive elements, offering a punchy contrast.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for a techy, attention-grabbing feel.
- Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif to maintain a clean and readable experience for stat descriptions and commentary.
- Use bold, playful icons related to GitHub activities to illustrate stats and commentary. Prefer a line art style to contrast against the dark background.
- Incorporate flashy transitions and animated charts for stats to mirror the Spotify Wrapped aesthetic. Short, punchy animations on the stats screen for excitement.
